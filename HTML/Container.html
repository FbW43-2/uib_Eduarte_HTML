            The word meme describes a basic unit of cultural idea or symbol that
            can be transmitted from one mind to another and, inherently,
            everyone knows what memes are.

            Precisely because of this Internet culture, we find a convergence in
            meanings and creative output, even away from the Internet.

            Colloquially, the terms meme and internet meme may refer to pieces
            of media that are designed in the format of true internet memes, but
            which are not themselves intended to spread or evolve, and which
            have recently become umbrella terms referring to any piece of
            quickly-consumed comedic or relatable content. What is considered a
            meme may vary across different communities on the internet and is
            subject to change over time

              In 2007 an Internet phenomenon known as Rickrolling became a meme,
              where users are tricked, via bait into watching the music video
              for Rick Astley’s 1987 hit “Never Gonna Give You Up.”

              Catchphrases and clichés often serve the purpose translating
              non-literal, cultural ideas, while similes and metaphors hint at
              what words portray. Those are all memes.
